## Search

- Search for local attractions. In this example, the user is searching for pizza and the map shows the 20 closest places that involve pizza.
- Select a pin for a search place and a polyline will appear with the shortest route to the destination
- Polylines can be removed using the double arrow icon in the top left of the screen
- Searched attractions can be removed from the map by clicking the circle arrow in the top left of the screen.
